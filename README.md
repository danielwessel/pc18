**Fischbachau, September 16-22, 2018**  
**Tutorial on Constructive Algebra**


This course gives an introduction to (some aspects of) constructive algebra. Special emphasis is put on the use of [entailment relations](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0d6d/cf4b90ce40edf701ef0c29e376db69473458.pdf).

I hope to complement Thierry Coquand's [summer school](http://www.him.uni-bonn.de/en/application/types-sets-constructions/summer-school/) lectures at the Hausdorff Research Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, May 3-9, 2018. Please have a look at the respective [course website](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~coquand/BONN/index.html) for the slides and a recommended reading list. Coquand's [lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guy60QCTNrk) have been recorded.

Here are some suggestions for further reading:

Edwards has shed light on [Kronecker's place in history](http://mcps.umn.edu/philosophy/11_5Edwards.pdf). See also [here](https://academic.oup.com/blms/article-abstract/15/1/8/271335?redirectedFrom=PDF) and [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF03025208). (Alas, lodged behind a pay wall.)

Hilbert's programme in abstract algebra has been put under scrutiny by Crosilla and Schuster; see [here](http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~pmtmlcr/papers/CrosillaSchuster.pdf).

Lorenzen's contributions are currently being revived by Coquand, Lombardi, and Neuwirth; see [here](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01629913/document) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05115).

Richman's [non-trivial uses of trivial rings](https://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1988-103-04/S0002-9939-1988-0954974-5/S0002-9939-1988-0954974-5.pdf) will be mentioned twice in the course.

[Here](http://apcz.umk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/LLP/article/viewFile/LLP.2013.009/732)'s an interesting paper on the roots of point-free topology.

Last but not least, *the* [book](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04832) is freely available on the arXiv!
